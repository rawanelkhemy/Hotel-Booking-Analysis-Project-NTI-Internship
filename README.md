# Hotel Booking Analysis | Python & Power BI

This project was created as part of my journey in the **Advanced Data Analysis track** during the **NTI Internship**, under the guidance of **Instructor Donia**. The objective was to explore hotel booking behaviors, uncover trends in cancellations, and deliver actionable insights through data visualization.

---

## ‚ú¶ Project Summary

The dataset contains over **119,000 hotel booking records**, capturing guest details, reservation patterns, and cancellation behavior.  
My goal was to clean the data, explore it deeply using EDA, and finally present the key findings in a clear and interactive Power BI dashboard.

## ‚ú¶ Tools & Libraries Used

**üîπ Python**  
- `pandas`, `numpy` ‚Üí data manipulation  
- `seaborn`, `matplotlib` ‚Üí data visualization  
- `scipy.stats` ‚Üí outlier detection  
- `sklearn.preprocessing.StandardScaler` ‚Üí scaling numeric features

**üîπ Power BI**  
- Cards, donut charts, bar charts, and slicers for interactivity  
- DAX measures for KPIs (e.g., cancellation rate, average lead time)

## ‚ú¶ Project Workflow

**1. Data Cleaning**
- Filled missing values based on data context
- Detected and handled outliers using Z-scores
- Applied feature scaling where appropriate  
- Final dataset was fully cleaned and consistent

**2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**
- Analyzed booking lead times, customer types, reservation statuses
- Compared cancellation rates across different segments
- Explored mismatches between reserved and assigned rooms

**3. Dashboard Development (Power BI)**
- Built an interactive dashboard with filters for hotel type, year, customer type, and market segment  
- Included KPI cards, bar charts, pie chart, and distribution visuals  
- Designed with simplicity and insight delivery in mind

## ‚ú¶ Key Insights

- ‚ùñ **37% of bookings were canceled**, with Transient and Transient-Party guests driving most of it  
- ‚ùñ Guests booked **an average of 104 days in advance**
- ‚ùñ The **average number of special requests was low (0.57)**  
- ‚ùñ There's a noticeable **gap between reserved and assigned room types** in some bookings  
- ‚ùñ Group and contract guests had **lower cancellation rates** compared to others  
- ‚ùñ Certain market segments like Online TA had higher booking activity and request patterns
